# Supply chain emissions using graph representation learning

## Background

A full background to the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ocuOPPNBEy_KtUUIM6BYEYsklD9zKiwa/view?usp=sharing). But here are the key points:
- Emissions are embedded in supply chains
- Direct emissions data within supply chains is sparse
- A multitude of indirect data sources could be used to infer emissions 
- Graph representation learning is a way of propagating emission estimates through a network based on multimodal data input
